Once upon a time, there was a little duck who dreamed of being more than just an ordinary duck. Every morning, the duck would waddle down to the pond, where the other ducks laughed and played. But this duck was different â€” it wanted to dance, to sing, and to fly higher than any duck had ever flown before. One day, the brave little duck flapped its wings with all its might, soared into the blue sky, and proved to every duck around that dreams really can come true.
